### MFMA-ACH


We build the MEC Network and get K-means clustering groups in "Init_ACH" via [Wireless Network Simulator version 2.0](https://github.com/trunk96/wireless-network-simulator-v2), so please cite the simulator:

The paper title of our MFMA-ACH is "Multifactorial Memetic Algorithm with Adaptive Auxiliary Tasks for Service Migration Optimization in 5G Mobile Edge Computing", which is under review.
